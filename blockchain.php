                                      <p>The foundational technology of bitcoin is blockchain. A distributed data storage functions as its core. Every member of this network has access to their own data store, which houses every transaction that has ever taken place on the network (this is also known as the distributed ledger).

                                      A cryptographic chain of blocks contains entries. The network of participants must always agree on the most recent block of transactions at each stage. The procedure of majority vote, removing duplicate entries, double expenditure, etc., results in agreement. The agreed-upon blockchain is made irreversible and immutable by this method and the layering of the blocks' cryptographic information. This technology prevents any participant from changing the "history" of events without the support of the majority of the other participants.

                                      <p>A smart contract is a piece of code that is installed on a blockchain. Every smart contract has code that is capable of receiving a predetermined set of inputs. Data can be kept in smart contracts as well. Smart contracts under this technology operate on each node in accordance with the distributed model of the blockchain, and each contract's data is saved in each node. Any time can be used to query this data. Aside from making calls to other smart contracts, enforcing permissions, executing workflow rules, and doing computations, smart contracts can also be used to conduct other tasks.</p>
